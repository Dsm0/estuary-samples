40 short stereo recordings of myself producing sound in various ways from an empty Maxwell House coffee can (some with my hands/finger, some with a wooden chopstick).  I used an old Zoom 4 mp3 recorder for the mic.

Oddly enough, the pitch of the can is roughly Ab/G#, so 

```
stack [s "coffee(11,16)" # n (run 40),
		n "0 ~ 12 ~ " # s "sprvibe" |+ n "af"]
```
will work together nicely, pitch-wise.
